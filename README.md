# Luis Felipe Montemayor

**Full-stack software engineer and researcher.**

I bridge the gap between research and production software. I began in biological research but have spent the last four years building infrastructure for large-scale genomic and transcriptomic analysis, designing production tools, and supporting technical teams across two early-stage startups.

I enjoy building ergonomic products that solve complex real life problems, from delivering production-ready platforms to increasing to super-charging the capabilities of technical teams.

### Experience & Projects
* **Data Infrastructure:** Led research engineering at Genpax, developing Python, R, Bash, and Nextflow pipelines to automate multi-GB omics data-processing. These increased daily analysis capacity 100x for the R&D team.
* **Production Software Design:** Designed and built the MVP for a genomics analysis platform for pathogen outbreak visualization, which is now approved for use by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority.
* **Stakeholder Management & UX:** At Genpax, I led design rounds with directors during prototyping of main product, collaborated with researchers to optimise their workflows across multiple projects and worked directly with clinicians to support 4 clinical studies studies across the UK and Europe. At Beans, I converted feedback from B2B clients into production features, now crucial in ongoing fund-raising round.
* **SaaS Engineering:** As a Founding Software Engineer at Beans, I built a full-stack data handling and analysis platform using ReScript, React, and Elixir. I engineered an LLM assistant using a Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage dynamic context and execute in-app functions for real-time visualization.
* **Deep Learning:** Implemented an internal-use PyTorch GNN for plasmid detection, managing the full lifecycle from data curation to model training and deployment.
* **Research:** Conducted genetics research for three years at UCL, including high-throughput microscopy, large phenomics experiments, and transcriptomics analysis in the Bähler and Gems laboratories.

### Currently
* **Learning:** I am deeply interested in systems programming and am currently picking up **Rust**.
* **Sharpening:** Data Structures and Algorithms.
* **Building:** Currently looking for open-source projects to collaborate in and working on [Glia](https://github.com/luisfmontemayor/glia/), a telemetry suite for ephemeral jobs aimed at research and operational teams.
