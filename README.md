- 👋 Hi, I’m @luisfmontemayor, I am a Cell Biologist with a strong background in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Biology and Complex Biological System reseach.
- </> I currently know 3 programming languages to an advanced level: Python, R, and Unix/Linux (bash particularly).
- </> I have gained proficiency in SQL, Git and LaTeX through independent learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning approaches for biology.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on any type of data analysis research.
- 📫 How to reach me: luis.montemayor.17@ucl.ac.uk.



Welcome to my GItHub page! I am currently assembling code from across a series of projects to exhibit here, ultimately aiming to display them as markdowns.
    
    
   Projects with repositories currently listed (still being put into markdowns) are:
CellCycling: Master's Bioinformatics project: Characterizing lncRNA expression patterns as a function of the cell cylcle.
Senecio: Biological sampling data Statistical Analysis (R): Studying conditions affecting speciation the speciation of two Senecio species in Mt Etna.


   Previous projects I am currently assembling for upload:
-Tumour clonal reconstruction using a Dirichlet process (R).
-Association study practice, including GWAS and eQTL analysis (R).
-Modelling approaches to COVID19 using variations of the SIR model (Python).
-Modelling a Goodwin Occilator (Python).
-Estimation of evolutionary distance between Humans and Chimps through Bayesian inference (R).





Arrangements to see particular projects can be made, please contact me through luis.montemayor.17@ucl.ac.uk


Kind regards,
Luis Felipe Montemayor
