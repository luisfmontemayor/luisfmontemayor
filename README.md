- 👋 Hi, I’m @luisfmontemayor, I am a Cell Biologist with a background in Biology of Ageing research
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Biology and Dynamic Biological System reseach 
- </> I currently know 4 programming languages to an advanced level: Python, R, SQL and Unix Shell (bash particularly) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning approaches for biology
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on any type of data analysis research
- 📫 How to reach me: luis.montemayor.17@ucl.ac.uk


   Welcome to my GItHub page! I am currently assembling code from across a series of projects and displaying them as markdowns.
   
   Any of the projects listed
   
   The projects with repositories currently listed (still being put into markdowns) are:
-CellCycling: Master's Bioinformatics project: Characterizing lncRNA expression patterns as a function of the cell cylcle
-Senecio: Biological sampling data Statistical Analysis (R): Studying conditions affecting speciation the speciation of two Senecio species in Mt Etna

   The projects I am currently assembling include:
-Estimation of evolutionary distance between Humans and Chimps through Bayesian inference.
-Modelling approaches to COVID19 using variations of the SIR model (Python)

Arrangements to see particular projects can be made, please contact me through luis.montemayor.17@ucl.ac.uk




Kind regards,
Luis Felipe Montemayor
