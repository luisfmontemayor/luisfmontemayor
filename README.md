Welcome to my GItHub page! I am currently assembling code from across a series of projects to exhibit here, ultimately aiming to display them as markdowns.
<br />   
<br /> 
   Projects with repositories currently listed (still being put into markdowns) are: <br />
-CellCycling: Master's Bioinformatics project: Characterizing lncRNA expression patterns as a function of the cell cylcle. <br />
-Senecio: Biological sampling data Statistical Analysis (R): Studying conditions affecting speciation the speciation of two Senecio species in Mt Etna. <br />
<br />
<br />
   Previous projects I am currently assembling for upload: <br />
-Tumour clonal reconstruction using a Dirichlet process (R). <br />
-Association study practice, including GWAS and eQTL analysis (R). <br />
-Modelling approaches to COVID19 using variations of the SIR model (Python). <br />
-Modelling a Goodwin Occilator (Python). <br />
-Estimation of evolutionary distance between Humans and Chimps through Bayesian inference (R). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arrangements to see particular projects can be made, please contact me through lfelipemonte@gmail.com

<br />
Kind regards, <br />
